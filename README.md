KSPPluginFramework
================
The KSP Plugin Framework was developed as part of a rewrite of Kerbal Alarm Clock and KSP Alternate Resource Panel to provide some common code that could be reused with little or no modification.

It then became a project unto itself :)

This project contains a number of helper classes which include code to help you quickly build a plugin for [Kerbal Space Program](http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/)

The code can be used as is or as reference so that you can write your own
